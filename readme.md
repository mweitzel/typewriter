## typewriter

What is it with hipsters and their typewriters?

I don't know, but here's one for your terminal.

### usage

Works like you'd expect. Once its it your `$PATH`, just run

```bash
$ typewriter file
```

for an additive only editor. Exit with `CTRL-C`

And remember, no backups or saving! Everything is in ink from the start.

I don't know why you would want to use this.

Please don't use this.
